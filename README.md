# Employee Attendance and Overtime Information System
This website simplifies employee attendance by offering features for clocking in and out. It records
attendance times and links them to the administrator for monitoring arrival times. Additionally, employees
can submit overtime requests through the platform, which are then reviewed by the administrator for
approval or rejection. Approved requests result in a salary bonus for the employee. The website is built using
PHP MVC, Bootstrap 5, and MySQL.
